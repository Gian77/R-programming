# *R-programming*

## In this repo I save instructional files that help you/me to perform simple tasks in **R** and **GitHub** and how to connect the two, so, you can keep your code organized and tidy. It is, in fact, a collection of notes and links you can explore and go back to it every time you need. Keeping this repo up to date to the latest versions will be hard work, but I will do my best. In the maeantime, enjoy reading and, please, do not forget to **Watch**, **Fork**, and **Star** this repo if you think it was useful for you.
