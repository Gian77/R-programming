# *R-programming*

#### In this repo I save files that help me(you) to perform simple tasks in **R** and **GitHub** and how to connect the two. It is, in fact, a collection of notes and links you can explore and go back to it every time you need. I will try to regularly push content in this repo. In the maeantime, enjoy reading and, please, do not forget to **Watch**, **Fork**, and **Star** this repo if you think it was useful for you.
